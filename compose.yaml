# No external services (databases, cache, etc.) detected in the project context or Dockerfile.
# If you add a database or other service, add it here and configure depends_on and networks as needed.

# No volumes section needed as there are no persistent data services.

# If you add more services that need to communicate, define a network like this:
# networks:
#   appnet:
#     driver: bridge
